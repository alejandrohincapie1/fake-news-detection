      "Donald Trump once again found himself the lightning rod of the Republican presidential race Wednesday, as he tangled with a debate stage full of rivals trying to position themselves as the best alternative to the GOP front-runner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second Republican primary debate veered into serious policy territory – covering everything from Iran to Russia to Planned Parenthood to immigration. But, at times to the visible frustration of candidates trying to stick to those issues, few segments passed without a sparring session between Trump and one of his opponents. Almost every time, Trump hit back – and it was unclear whether any candidate would be able to dent his front-runner status.\n",
      "\n",
      "The candidate perhaps most eager to knock the billionaire businessman down a peg was former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lost his lead to Trump over the summer. Repeatedly, Bush challenged Trump on his record and past comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told Trump to apologize to his wife for suggesting her being from Mexico makes Bush more sympathetic to Mexicans – Trump refused.\n",
      "\n",
      "He accused Trump of once giving him money as he sought casino gambling, unsuccessfully, in Florida.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump denied it, and when Bush criticized Trump for bragging about demanding Hillary Clinton attend his wedding, Trump teased him, saying: “More energy tonight, I like that.” (Bush answered back at the end of the debate – asked what his Secret Service codename would be, Bush said, “Very High Energy, Donald,” and the two shared a high-five.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was such a disaster those last few months that Abraham Lincoln couldn’t have been elected,” Trump said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush responded that his brother “kept us safe.” Trump answered, “You feel safe right now?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the most heated exchanges at the CNN debate also came between Trump and former HP CEO Carly Fiorina, both business leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Trump called her former company a “disaster,” she cited his repeated bankruptcy filings and questioned why America should trust him to manage its finances.\n",
      "\n",
      "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie interjected and said middle-class Americans “could care less about your careers.” He told the two to “stop this childish back and forth.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina also got her chance at the debate to respond to Trump’s controversial jab at her, where in a magazine article he said: “Look at that face – would anyone vote for that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked to respond, she said, “I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina received loud applause for the line, and Trump added, “I think she’s got a beautiful face, and I think she’s a beautiful woman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite all the attention on Trump, his dominant lead in the polls means his rivals may be battling at this stage for runner-up, for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson currently holds that status after vaulting into second place in the polls – yet was able to avoid the fray for most of Wednesday’s debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took one light-hearted jab at Trump, after Trump discussed his views on vaccines and said there are cases of children getting sick – and having autism – after getting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asked about Trump’s medical opinion, Carson said, “He’s an okay doctor” – in reference to a comment Trump recently made about him. Carson went on to say there’s no documented association between autism and vaccines, but doctors are probably giving too many vaccines in a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the exchange about George W. Bush, Carson also noted that he did not want Bush to “go to war” in Iraq. He added that radical jihadists now are an “existential threat to our nation” and leaders can’t “put our heads in the sand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the sparring with Trump, the candidates did have a chance to stake out their positions on a range of policy issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina, in an impassioned moment in the debate, appealed to Congress to defund Planned Parenthood following videos exposing organ harvesting from aborted fetuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is about the character of our nation. And if we will not stand up and force President Obama to veto this bill, shame on us,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee slammed a federal judge for temporarily jailing Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, saying the U.S. has made religious “accommodations” for Guantanamo detainees and the Fort Hood shooter, but Davis is facing a “criminalization of her faith.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said of the agreement with Tehran, “I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Ohio Gov. John Kasich urged against going that far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also focused on foreign policy, warning about China’s military build-up, and “gangsters in Moscow” meddling on the world stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this, Rubio challenged Trump’s global affairs knowledge. Trump vowed, “I will know more about the problems of this world” as president. And he criticized Rubio for missing votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump’s fitness to be commander-in-chief was a common theme for his rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina said, when asked if she’s comfortable with Trump controlling America’s nuclear weapons: “I think Mr. Trump is a wonderful entertainer.” She said “judgment” and “temperament” will be revealed “over time and under pressure” in the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump answered: “I may be an entertainer. … but I will tell you this. What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump also went after Sen. Rand Paul, saying he shouldn’t even be on the stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump,” Paul answered, but he added he’s concerned about him being in charge of nuclear weapons. Paul chastised Trump for his “visceral response,” including attacking people on their appearance which he likened to “junior high.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump said he never did that to Paul, quipping: “Believe me there’s plenty of subject matter right there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also zinged Trump, saying: “We don’t need an apprentice in the White House. We have one right now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Walker and Bush have both seen their polling numbers drop in recent weeks as Trump, and now Carson, have risen. Walker is trying to refocus his campaign on his record as governor, and record battling labor unions; the latter issue did not surface much during Wednesday’s debate, though. In his closing remarks, Walked vowed that as a leader, “I won’t back down any day, any way, anyhow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "An unexpected clash also broke out at the end, when Paul made a veiled reference to Bush having smoked marijuana years ago as Paul challenged federal marijuana policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bush acknowledged Paul was talking about him and said: “40 years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Paul then claimed people with “privilege” don’t go to jail for marijuana, but others do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main stage at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Wednesday night featured the 11 top-polling candidates. It followed an earlier undercard debate of four lower-polling candidates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiorina, while rising in the polls, is still averaging just over 3 percent nationally, according to RealClearPolitics. Bush, once the front-runner, is at about 8 percent. Walker is down to 3 percent. Cruz and Rubio remain in the middle of the pack, trailing slightly behind Bush.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with Carson and Trump attracting the support of roughly half of primary voters, the other 14 candidates are fighting for relative scraps. Trump’s national lead now tops 30 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the earlier undercard debate, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tangled often with his GOP rivals, positioning himself as an experienced, practical lawmaker not beholden to conservative activist causes. He focused squarely on the need to defeat radical Islamic terrorists, while Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal focused at that debate on religious freedom issues.\n",

      "The nation’s largest veterans group hit back at President Obama on Thursday and urged him not to “denigrate” their intelligence after the president suggested their members were easily swayed by cable news and “right-wing radio.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Veterans of Foreign Wars called out the president after Obama referenced the political opinions at “VFW halls” in an Indiana speech Wednesday that toggled between campaign politics and the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know how many VFW Posts the president has ever visited, but our near 1.7 million members are a direct reflection of America,” VFW National Commander John A. Biedrzycki Jr. said in a statement. “We don’t have confused politics, we don’t need left or rightwing media filters telling us how to think or vote, and we don’t need any President of the United States lecturing us about how we are individually [affected] by the economy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama, speaking in Elkhart, Ind., had lamented the “primary story” he claimed Republicans are telling about the economy – one that focuses on how “moochers at the bottom of the income ladder” are squeezing middle-class families.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have been hearing this story for decades,” Obama said. “Tales about welfare queens, talking about takers, talking about the ‘47percent.’ It's the story that is broadcast every day on some cable news stations, on right-wing radio, it's pumped into cars, and bars, and VFW halls all across America, and right here in Elkhart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama continued: “And if you're hearing that story all the time, you start believing it. It's no wonder people think big government is the problem.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Biedrzycki suggested veterans are not so easily swayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our nation was created and continues to exist solely because of the men and women who wear the uniform,” he said. “Let’s not denigrate their service, their sacrifice or their intelligence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama is no stranger to the VFW, having addressed the group’s national convention several times dating back to his first presidential campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "He last spoke to the VFW convention last July in Pittsburgh, calling the occasion a “great honor.” He used the speech to address ongoing efforts to help America’s veterans, especially in the area of health care, in the wake of the Veterans Affairs wait-times scandal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As president, I consider it my obligation to help make sure that, even though less than 1 percent of Americans wear the uniform, that 100 percent of Americans honor your sacrifices and your service,” he said.\n",

      "Writing at the Hill, analyst Mark Plotkin figures he knows why Ted Cruz's poll numbers have tanked in Indiana: rings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember when the Republican presidential candidate stumbled over the word \"rim\" as he was trying to re-create a scene from the movie \"Hoosiers\" (for some reason)? Well, that slip-up will \"doom him\" in basketball-loving Indiana, just as so many have been doomed by so many other slips of the tongue before. Indianans love basketball very much, apparently, and they will be very mad if you say \"ring\" to them. (\"Traditionally, we call that a 'hoop' here in Indiana,\" the Indianapolis Star's Allison Carter noted dryly.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, look at the polls! The Cruz mistake happened April 26; shortly thereafter, his poll numbers started to sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard to argue with that. Except that something else happened April 26: Donald Trump beat the tar out of Cruz and Ted Kasich in five states.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Republican race has been a teacup ride for the ages, whipping back and forth between \"Trump is doomed\" and \"Trump is inevitable,\" usually based on whatever good or bad luck Trump has had in the most recent voting. His past six efforts have been exceptional, his best of the campaign, so our teacups are spinning toward \"inevitable\" once again, and faster than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that makes some sense: There aren't many contests left, and Trump's magic number — how many of the remaining delegates he needs — continues to sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indiana is one of the two biggest states left on the calendar, and it gives out its delegates in a \"winner-take-most\" fashion — win the state and the congressional districts, and you get all the delegates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Trump has won six in a row, and by very wide margins. But just as Bernie Sanders won seven of eight before the race shifted back to Hillary Clinton-friendly territory, Indiana ain't the Northeast. (In the Northeast, no one has any idea what to call a basketball loop.) The Midwest is different terrain, where Trump's margins of victory have been more modest — when he has won.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's say, for example, that Trump doesn't win Indiana's primary Tuesday. This is unlikely. FiveThirtyEight's forecast shows that Trump has an 83 percent chance of winning. There are reports that Trump is finally figuring out how to run a ground game — that is, how to get his supporters to the polls. But Cruz has consistently been stronger and smarter, which is one reason he pulled off a surprise win in Iowa. That was a caucus and not a primary, one of several reasons he probably will still lose in Indiana. But if he doesn't? Back go the teacups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if Cruz loses and Trump wins — as is likely — the race isn't over. Winning Indiana's delegates makes Trump's job much easier, particularly given his big lead in New Jersey — the third biggest state left and one that gives all of its delegates to the winner — and in California. Both of those states will vote June 7, and, between the two of them, will offer Trump enough delegates to clinch the nomination.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's go back to Indiana. One of the reasons polls appear to have shifted against Cruz in the state is that the air is coming out of his campaign. Gallup's survey data indicates that Cruz's favorability rating has tanked among Republicans since Trump's big victory in New York. The implication? People who were supporting Cruz out of a desire to stop Trump have lost some of that enthusiasm. This also could explain the dip in Indiana.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also suggests that opinions are relatively fickle, driven by a sense of viability. Even if Cruz doesn't win tonight, a better-than-expected performance, a close race, could prompt some rethinking. Plus, there are still several states between now and June 7 where Cruz could do well: Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana. If voters are responding to the variations of the race, as polls suggest, we could have another variation in the cards, even if Trump wins in Indiana. Maybe. Possibly. (There are a bunch of states where Trump will do well, too.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand why Trump keeps insisting that an Indiana win would cap off his nomination. I understand — and agree with — arguments suggesting that it makes his nomination all but certain. But I'd note that our impulses to declare finality in the wake of particular results often have proven to be short-lived. Trump wouldn't actually clinch until the night of June 7 — about a month from now. One month ago, Cruz was about to dominate in Wisconsin and give the wan \"Stop Trump\" effort its only real win.

      "The brilliant lawyers at Judicial Watch just did something that is sending SHOCK WAVES through the Obama White House. They are filling official requests to learn every detail about President Barack Obama’s illegal and unconstitutional plan to import thousands of Muslim Syrian “refugees” into America. And they are already taking Obama to court to force him to turn over this information. \n",
      "This bold legal action will expose Obama’s corruption to sunlight, and could quickly be the end of the Syrian refugee program. Incredible! \n",
      "Judicial Watch is suing the Department of State for documents related to President Barack Obama’s Refugee and Resettlement program as part of an investigation into the Obama administration’s plan to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next year, the conservative foundation announced Monday. \n",
      "The suit was filed in Washington, D.C., after the State Department failed to respond to two Freedom of Information Act requests from Judicial Watch in 2015. In May, Judicial Watch sought records related to the State Department’s agreements and interactions with voluntary agencies that help place and assist new refugees. In September, Judicial Watch sought records regarding an August meeting between State Department representatives and a South Carolina non-profit. \n",

      "Waco, Texas (CNN) A memo has gone out to law enforcement in the wake of Sunday's shooting, warning officers that members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle gangs reportedly had been instructed to arm themselves and travel to north Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Obviously it's something we're concerned about. We would encourage biker groups to stand down. There's been enough bloodshed. There's been enough death here,\" Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" on Monday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time the Sunday melee was over, at least nine people were dead, 18 were hospitalized and at least 170 were arrested and charged.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biker gang members who began beating, stabbing and shooting each other in a Texas Twin Peaks restaurant knew the police were outside; they just didn't care, Swanton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "For two months, police concerned with the bikers' presence at Twin Peaks, which hosted special events for its leather-clad clientele, had patrolled outside -- and not in plain clothes and unmarked cars, either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We wanted our presence to be known,\" Swanton told reporters. \"They knew we were seconds away and going to respond. That mattered not to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Clubs of Waco billed Sunday's event as the Texas Region 1 Confederation of Clubs and Independents meeting. Before the restaurant and surrounding parking lots became a bloody battleground, the Waco Police Department had 18 officers on the scene, including an assistant chief and tactical officers, along with four officers with the Texas Department of Public Safety, Swanton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "An altercation in the bathroom seems to have sparked the violence. Shots were fired inside the eatery and a brawl spilled onto the patio area, before scores of men flooded the parking lot in broad daylight. Some bikers were beaten with brass knuckles, clubs and chains, while others were stabbed or shot, Swanton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "When police responded -- within 30 to 45 seconds because of their proximity -- the bikers turned their weapons on law enforcement, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Our officers took fire and responded appropriately, returning fire,\" the sergeant said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As police rounded up suspects and paramedics tended to the injured, investigators found eight bodies -- three in the parking lot behind Twin Peaks, four near the front of the restaurant and one that had been dragged behind a nearby establishment, Swanton said. More than 100 weapons were confiscated as well, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another victim died at a hospital, where doctors treated patients for gunshots, stab wounds, blunt-force trauma or some combination of the three.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a law enforcement source, preliminary information indicates that four of the bikers killed were killed by police gunfire. The investigation continues and the ballistics will be analyzed to determine for certain who was responsible for each shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swanton called it \"the most violent and gruesome scene that I have dealt with\" in three and a half decades of law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scores of suspects, who hail from five different biker gangs, remained locked up in the McLennan County Jail on Monday facing charges of engaging in organized crime, Swanton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors and investigators could level other charges -- and capital murder charges are expected to be among them, given the body count -- but the organized crime charge is \"pretty serious,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't get much more significant than that,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said that bond was being set at $1 million for each of the 170 people in custody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swanton would not release the names of the gangs involved. Photos from the scene showed bikers wearing the insignias of the Cossacks, Bandidos, Scimitars and Vaqueros, but it was not clear if the photographed gang members were involved in the fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Swanton briefed reporters at the crime scene Monday afternoon, 24 hours after the brawl, he said tactical units remained on the scene to protect journalists and investigators. Police hoped to finish processing the scene by sundown, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission shut down the Twin Peaks location, known for \"bike nights\" and its risque dress code for servers, for the next week. It wasn't a punitive measure, Swanton said; rather, it was closed because there's \"enough of a reason to believe that more violence would occur there, had they been allowed to remain open for the next seven-day period,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later Monday morning, the commission said it was suspending the restaurant's liquor license for those seven days while its agents investigate what happened. The investigation could yield anything from a fine to the permanent revocation of Twin Peaks' liquor license, commission spokesman Chris Porter said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There have been no previous complaints or actions taken against the eatery, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are in the people business and the safety of the employees and guests in our restaurants is priority one,\" the restaurant chain's statement read. \"Unfortunately the management team of the franchised restaurant in Waco chose to ignore the warnings and advice from both the police and our company, and did not uphold the high security standards we have in place to ensure everyone is safe at our restaurants.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It further said the corporate office would be \"revoking their franchise agreement immediately. Our sympathies continue to be with the families of those who died and are very thankful no employees, guests, police officers or bystanders were hurt or injured.​\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Waco restaurant's Facebook account, which had been a landing page for harsh criticism of the franchise, was deleted shortly thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swanton slammed Twin Peaks after the bloodshed Sunday, saying the franchise failed to help avoid trouble and ignored the police department's advice to try to keep biker gangs away from the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are we frustrated? Sure, because we feel like there may have been more that could have been done by a business to prevent this,\" Swanton said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said Twin Peaks has a right to deny entry to known biker gangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before word came of the franchise being revoked, Jay Patel, operating partner at the Waco Twin Peaks, said his staff was cooperating with police.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are horrified by the criminal, violent acts that occurred outside of our Waco restaurant today,\" Patel said Sunday night on Facebook. \"We share in the community's trauma.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The franchise released a statement Monday, saying it was working hard to learn the facts about the shooting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is important to clarify that, to the best of our knowledge, law enforcement officials did not ask either the Waco restaurant operator (with whom they spoke several times) or the Twin Peaks franchisor to cancel the patio reservation that was made on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Based on the information to date, we also believe that the violence began outside in the area of the parking lot, and not inside our restaurant or on our patio, as has been widely reported,\" it read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after the chaos subsided, Waco police continued arresting people arriving at the scene with weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swanton warned other biker gang members against coming to Waco to reignite the violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have been getting reports throughout the day that bikers from out of state are headed this way,\" he told KTVT on Sunday. \"We would encourage them not to, because we have plenty of space in our county jail to put them there.\"\n",

      "A peaceful valley in the mountains of Colorado becomes a battleground pitting the federal government against a rural sheriff’s department. Sheriff Bear Ellison finds himself increasingly isolated as he is forced to decide between risking his life protecting a local hero, or reneging on his oath and handing him over to federal prosecutors… \n",
      "\n",
      "Chapter 8 \n",
      "Cold winds poured down off the mountains and swirled in the valley, heralding the end of Indian summer. Billowing cumulonimbus clouds boiled upwards into the stratosphere, dwarfing the fourteen-thousand-foot peaks to the west. The aspen on the northern slopes had lost the last of their leaves and the cottonwoods and willows that clustered in the arroyos and flood plains had turned yellow. The elk had made their way down off the high meadows, and the mule deer were more common, grazing along the shoulders of the highway, sizing up their prospects of safe crossing. \n",
      "Sheriff Ellison drove his patrols with a heavy heart. Nguyet had made her decision. She was leaving for Atlanta, and he would soon be alone. He wished his term was over so that he could jettison his responsibilities and join her and his new granddaughter. The visit with Acevedo had cured him of any lingering political aspirations. Despite the DEA’s wishes, he never did give a press conference on the accidental shooting. \n",
      "What would be the point? he thought. Acevedo was right in one sense. The sheriff would have been held responsible for the shooting, regardless of how he framed it for the public. \n",
      "Ellison conceded that he would not be able to reign in the feds. He knew that the populace had most likely also realized this by now, and this painted him in a pastel hue of weakness. He noticed that people in general had become less social and cordial towards him since the botched raid. “Good morning, Sheriff. How are things?” was replaced with a cursory “Howdy” or a perfunctory nod, followed by averted eyes. This, along with his wife’s looming departure, filled him with a feeling of isolation. The DEA raids would continue, despite his protest. Nguyet had begged him to resign, but he just couldn’t. Not at such a chaotic time in his career. \n",
      "Ellison’s hope was that the county might turn against the DEA occupation. Monte Turcot was a hero, after all, and the shooting of him and his wife was a lightning rod. He hoped that the citizens were beginning to question the value of the DEA’s mission, but without effective leadership and organization, they would be helpless to foment any real resistance. \n",
      "Ellison knew Acevedo was disappointed that he did not do the requested damage control on the DEA’s behalf. He learned of this through a phone call with the governor’s office, whom the DEA had contacted to voice their displeasure. They had called him demanding an explanation. \n",
      "“There’s nothing for my department to communicate,” Ellison had explained over the phone. “We were not involved in that operation… We have asked DA Chalmers to launch a grand jury investigation… We expect their decision any day… I’ve ordered Special Agent Acevedo to suspend operations… No, he has not complied… I respectfully disagree with your assessment… I will take the governor’s position under advisement…” \n",
      "The DEA continued according to their plan. It didn’t matter to them what the sheriff or a constituency of “rancheros and hippy flameouts” thought of their operation. Their mission was ordained by the president. Provincial resistance was futile. Those who stood athwart them would be ignored or swept aside. Acevedo and his agents conducted three more raids after the Turcot shooting, adding to their tally of minor victories in the War on Drugs at a taxpayer cost of over $100,000 per arrest. Thankfully, no one else was shot. \n",
      "One afternoon, while on patrol, Ellison received a text on his cell phone. He glanced at it quickly, then turned off the road to change direction. An email from DA Chalmers came moments later. \n",
      "“Re: Turcot Shooting,” it read. “GJ has decided not to pursue.” \n",
      "Ellison stepped on the gas. He turned west onto County Road 306 and north just after the golf course, taking Gun Club Road for two miles and over Michigan Ditch where it ended at the intersection of a dirt road running east and west. Ellison turned west, his cruiser’s tires throwing up rocks and a plume of dust as he accelerated up the road that led into the hills and evergreen forest. Ten minutes from when he had received the email, he was pulling into Monte Turcot’s driveway. He shut off his cruiser, looked at his watch, took a deep breath, then got out and walked up to the door. As he raised his hand to knock, the recognizable pop of gunfire echoed through the trees. Instinctively, Ellison reached down towards his holster. Another shot rang out, then another, and another, in deliberate succession. The sounds were coming from behind Turcot’s trailer, where it abutted the woods. \n",
      "Cautiously, the sheriff made his way around the trailer, ready to draw if necessary. As he stepped out from behind it, the source of the shooting finally came into view. It was Monte Turcot himself, now bearded and thin, firing rounds into a tree trunk with a small pistol. His back was turned to the sheriff, and a half empty bottle of Jim Beam sat clasped in his other hand. \n",
      "“Don’t shoot me, Monte. I’m right behind you,” Ellison called. \n",
      "Monte staggered a few steps back and lowered his gun. \n",
      "“Listen, I came out here to talk to you.” \n",
      "Without even acknowledging the sheriff’s presence, Monte took a swig from the bottle, his pistol now dangling in his hand like a toy gun at his side. Ellison kept his hand close to his holster and made a quick glance about, looking for cover in the event that Monte had in fact lost his marbles and was mulling over the idea of suicide by cop. \n",
      "“Can we talk?” asked Ellison. \n",
      "Monte stared into the woods, wobbling, his back still turned to the sheriff. After another swig, he lowered his bottle, holding it so loosely that Ellison wondered if it might slip out and crash on the rocks at his feet. \n",
      "“Monte?” \n",
      "Monte didn’t move. \n",
      "“Okay, Monte,” Ellison explained slowly. “I’m going to go back to my car and check my messages and call in. That’ll take me about five minutes or so. Then I’ll be on my way. If you want, you can come over and talk. Or call me later. Does that sound okay with you?” \n",
      "Monte didn’t respond, swaying in the autumn air. A gust of wind blew pine cones off the trees, which landed with a thunk on his trailer’s metal roof. Ellison backed away behind the trailer and walked back to his cruiser. Inside, he radioed a quick status report to dispatch and then checked his messages. Nguyet was wondering when he would be home for dinner. His son had emailed pictures of his granddaughter. A reporter from the Gazette wanted to talk about his reelection campaign. Someone had sent a note about a roadkill carcass on the highway north of town. \n",
      "Something moved in the corner of his eye. Ellison glanced up and was startled to find the ragged Monte Turcot framed in his windshield. He looked pale, his hair was matted, and his filthy sweatshirt was stained with blood. Ellison looked at his hands. Monte was no longer wielding the pistol, but he still clung to the bottle. From the looks of it, he’d had a few more drinks since the sheriff had arrived. \n",
      "Relieved but still cautious, Ellison rolled down the passenger window. “Get in, Monte.” \n",
      "Monte stared back, his blank expression evoking that of a zombie’s. Ellison clipped his cell phone into its mount on the dash, then reached over and opened the passenger door. Monte slowly shuffled towards it and got in. \n",
      "“How are you holding up, Monte?” Ellison asked. \n",
      "“Still here,” he answered in a raspy tone. \n",
      "“This is a terrible thing you’re going through. I wish there was something I could do to help.” \n",
      "“Thanks,” murmured Monte. \n",
      "“What’s that blood from, on your shirt there?” \n",
      "“Tore my hands up chopping wood.” \n",
      "“Did you cut yourself?” \n",
      "“No.” Monte set his bottle down on the floorboard and presented the palms of his hands to the sheriff. They were covered in blisters, some of which had burst. The tender layer of skin beneath had torn open. \n",
      "“You should take care of that,” Ellison warned him. “It could get infected.” \n",
      "“Yeah…you’re probably right.” \n",
      "“Looks like you did a lot of chopping.” \n",
      "“Four cords,” Monte stated quietly. \n",
      "“How long did that take you?” \n",
      "“I split it all yesterday.” \n",
      "“That ought to be plenty to get you through winter in that trailer of yours.” \n",
      "Monte stared out the passenger window. The mountains appeared through a break in the ponderosa that lined his drive, their peaks sheathed in the purest of white. \n",
      "“It certainly is beautiful out here this time of year,” the sheriff observed. \n",
      "“I think I might just walk myself up into those mountains and never come back down,” Monte answered in a quiet, resigned sigh. “You ever think about doing something like that, Sheriff?” \n",
      "“I think about that a lot, Monte. Maybe not exactly like you describe it, but there are a lot of days – too many days – when I think about dropping everything and going away, going away for a while.” \n",
      "“I ain’t talking about for a while . I’m talking about for good.” \n",
      "“You wouldn’t be planning on bringing that gun along with you, would you?” asked Ellison. \n",
      "“You know, I don’t really plan anything, anymore.” Monte looked down at his ravaged hands. “The future changes day by day. Sometimes I think about going back to active duty again, volunteering for all the action. I thought for sure that was going to be my future yesterday. But then today, I don’t think that’s such a good idea. Today, I think I’ve seen enough killing for one lifetime. I don’t want any part of that no more. Right now, I wish I’d never joined in the first place.” He shrugged. “But then again, who knows? Tomorrow, I’ll probably wish I never came home.” \n",
      "“It’s got to be tough, dealing with everything you’ve been through,” Ellison answered. “It’s too much for one man.” \n",
      "“Yeah.” Monte nodded slowly. “I’m ashamed of the things that I thought about doing yesterday.” \n",
      "“What sort of things?” \n",
      "“I’m worried about you, Monte.” \n",
      "“What do you know about anything, Sheriff?” \n",
      "“You’re right. I don’t know much about what you’re going through. I just worry.” \n",
      "“Don’t.” \n",
      "“Monte,” Ellison said, wary of the direction he was about to take the conversation, “I came out here to check up on you. It doesn’t look like you’re doing well. I don’t think you’re out of line or anything, all things considered. I just think you’re out here all alone, and that it’s not good for you. Is there any way I could talk you into staying with some family for a while? You’ve got a sister, don’t you? Maybe she could come out and stay with you, or you could go visit her.” \n",
      "“She lives in Connecticut. She’s got four kids.” \n",
      "“What about your parents?” \n",
      "“They’re old, worn down, worn out. I’d be a burden on them. I don’t want to deal with them right now, anyway.” \n",
      "“Monte…I wouldn’t feel right about just leaving you out here without knowing you’re going to get some help. Everyone needs help, sometimes. There isn’t any shame in that.” \n",
      "Monte turned from the window and looked at Ellison. “So what happened with the grand jury? That’s really why you came out here, isn’t it? To tell me about that?” \n",
      "Ellison felt relieved that Monte had broached the subject first. He hadn’t been able to figure out a way to get there gracefully by himself. \n",
      "“They concluded that, under applicable law, no criminal charges will be filed against the DEA agent that shot you and your wife. I’m sorry.” He watched as Monte’s eyes dimmed in helpless frustration. “For the record, that’s the DA’s language, not mine. I think it’s wrong.” \n",
      "“I can’t say that I’m surprised,” Monte replied. He picked his bottle off the floorboards and opened the door. “I think I’m going to go back inside and lay down for a while.” \n",
      "“Okay, Monte. I’ll stay out here for a few minutes, if you don’t mind.” \n",
      "“Don’t worry, Sheriff. I’ll be all right,” answered Monte. “I just need to get some rest. These hands are hurting real bad, and I’m pretty drunk.” He stumbled out of the cruiser and staggered slowly back into his trailer, letting the door slam shut behind him. \n",
      "Sheriff Ellison waited outside with his window down, listening for a gunshot for over an hour.\n",

      "Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald on Tuesday apologized for lying about serving in the special operations forces in a conversation with a homeless veteran that was caught on camera earlier this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDonald made the claim in January while he was in Los Angeles as part of the VA's effort to locate and house homeless veterans. During the tour, a homeless man told McDonald that he had served in the special operations forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Special forces? What years?\" McDonald responded. \"I was in special forces.\" The exchange was broadcast on \"The CBS Evening News\" Jan. 30. McDonald's misstatement was first reported by The Huffington Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDonald graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1975 and completed Army Ranger training before being assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division until his retirement in 1980. According to the Huffington Post, while McDonald was formally recognized as a graduate of Ranger School, he never actually served in a Ranger battalion or other special operations unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have no excuse,\" the website quoted McDonald as saying in its report. \"I was not in special forces.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a statement released Monday by the VA, McDonald said: \"While I was in Los Angeles, engaging a homeless individual to determine his veteran status, I asked the man where he had served in the military. He responded that he had served in special forces. I incorrectly stated that I had been in special forces. That was inaccurate and I apologize to anyone that was offended by my misstatement.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At a news conference outside VA offices on Tuesday, McDonald also told reporters he made the misstatement in a conversation with a homeless veteran he was trying \"to connect with.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "McDonald added: \"I apologize for that. I have no excuse for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The VA secretary has drawn expressions of disappointment, but no demands for his resignation. \"A lie is a lie,\" said Michael Helm, national commander of the American Legion, the largest veterans service organization. \"I can't believe people do this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "McDonald told the Huffington Post that he had \"reacted spontaneously and ... wrongly\" in response to the homeless man's claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As I thought about it later, I knew that this was wrong,\" McDonald said of his false statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Republican lawmakers on Tuesday were critical of McDonald over the false claim, but indicated they want to keep the focus on reforming the department itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., said he was \"disappointed\" in his comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"After a rough couple of weeks that also included inflated claims of accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs, I hope Sec. McDonald will redouble his efforts to ensure his statements -- and those of all VA officials -- are completely accurate. This is the only way the department can regain the trust of the veterans and taxpayers it is charged with serving,\" he said in a statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., called the misstatement an error but said \"it doesn't dim the fact that he served honorably.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He said: \"We should all take him at his word and Washington shouldn't spend the next two weeks arguing about it. The Secretary has a job to do -- clean up the scandal-plagued VA. This latest controversy shouldn't shift one iota of focus away from that long overdue task.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The White House released a statement Monday evening saying that it had accepted McDonald's explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Secretary McDonald has apologized for the misstatement and noted that he never intended to misrepresent his military service,\" the statement said. \"We take him at his word and expect that this will not impact the important work he’s doing to promote the health and well-being of our nation’s veterans.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After leaving the Army, McDonald went on to a successful corporate career, eventually becoming Chairman, President, and CEO of Proctor & Gamble. He became VA secretary this past July, as the agency was dealing with the fallout from the scandal of long patient wait times at VA hospitals.\n",

Despite his West Virginia win, Clinton maintains a significant lead and is 94 percent toward securing the nomination, though she faces challenges, including an FBI investigation and discontent among Sanders supporters. On the Republican side, Donald Trump won in West Virginia and Nebraska, and is seeking a running mate while attempting to unify the party amid differences with figures like Marco Rubio. Both parties are grappling with internal divisions as they prepare for the general election.\n",

Jeb Bush and Carly Fiorina, as they sought to position themselves as alternatives to the GOP front-runner. The debate covered various policy issues, but often devolved into personal exchanges, particularly between Trump and Bush. Despite the challenges from his opponents, Trump's significant lead in the polls suggests they may be competing for second place. Other candidates, like Ben Carson and Marco Rubio, also attempted to assert their positions, but Trump's dominance remained a central theme throughout the evening.\n",
